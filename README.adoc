== Installation

The released `rnp` snap package is located at Snapcraft: https://snapcraft.io/rnp[rnp snap].


== Building the package

* Run `snapcraft snap` in the root directory of this repo


== Testing the package

If you are on macOS you can install snap to any of your multipass instances with:

[source,sh]
----
multipass transfer rnp_*_amd64.snap ${instance-name}:/home/multipass
multipass shell ${instance-name}
sudo snap install --devmode rnp_*_amd64.snap
----

After this the snap is ready to use.


=== Testing uninstallation

Execute the following command to uninstall rnp.

[source,sh]
----
sudo snap remove rnp
----

After executing the uninstall ensure that the `rnp` executable is no longer found.

You can also try running `rnp --VERSION` from the command-line to see if it is still installed.
